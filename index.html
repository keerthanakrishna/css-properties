                                hazelnut product produced by the Italian confectionery company Ferrero. Its creation is
                                attributed to Michele Ferrero, previously the owner of Ferrero SpA, who introduced the
                                sweet in 1979.Each Ferrero Rocher ball is covered in foil and placed into a paper liner.
                                The
                                confectionery is machine made and much of its production process is designed to be
                                secretive.The candy is sold worldwide and holds a strong cultural presence, in part
                                due to its association with Christmas and its popular 1990s advertthat aired in the
                                United Kingdom.Ferrero Rocher offers a unique taste experience of contrasting layers: a
                                whole
                                crunchy hazelnut in the heart, a delicious creamy hazelnut filling, a crisp wafer .</p>

                            <p id="bg1">Ferrero Rocher was introduced in 1979 in Italy and in other parts of Europe in
                                1982. Shortly after its release, production was halted due to a problem with label
                                printing.Michele Ferrero, the credited inventor, named the chocolate after a grotto in
                                the Roman Catholic shrine of Lourdes, Rocher de Massabielle.Rocher comes from French and
                                means rock or boulder. </p>

                                inside the production facilities. As of 2015, few journalists have ever been invited to
                                visit.As of 2015, the production in the Alba factory totals 24 million Ferrero
                                Rochers a day.The sweet is produced by machinery. The process begins with flat sheets of wafer with
                                hemispheres moving down an assembly line.The hemispheres of the wafers are then
                                filled with a chocolate hazelnut cream and part of a hazelnut. Next, two of these wafer
                                sheets, one with a hazelnut and one with hazelnut chocolate cream, are clamped together.
                                The excess wafer is cut away producing wafer balls. These balls are then coated with a
                                layer of chocolate, a layer of chopped hazelnuts, and a final layer of milk chocolate
                                before the chocolate ball is wrapped in its prominent gold foil.</p>
